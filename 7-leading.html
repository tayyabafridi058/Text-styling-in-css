  <h1>line height</h1>
  <p>This indicates that every line in
    a paragraph, except the last line,
    should be set to take up the full
    width of the containing box.
    When you have several
    paragraphs of text, it is
    considered easiest to read if the
    text is left-aligned.
    Justified text looks at the words
    on each individual line and
    creates an equal gap between
    those words. It can look odd
    if you end up with large gaps
    between some words and
    smaller gaps between others.
    This often happens when your
    lines are not very wide or when
    your text contains long words.
